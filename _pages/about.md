Hello! I'm Javier Porras-Valenzuela, a second-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor Alejandro Ribeiro. My research interests include: GNNs, transformers, optimization, LLMs, and RL/Stochastic Optimization. 

In a past life, I worked as a software and ML engineer for 7+ years, applying ML and OR to areas such as Supply Chain, Fraud Detection, and AdTech.
